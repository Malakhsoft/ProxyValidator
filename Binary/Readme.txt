You can use https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list and download the CSV version of all available Proxies.

Store it inside the same folder as Proxy.exe

Run Proxy.exe and the program will detect all working Proxy Servers inside Free_Proxy_List.csv

at the end of the session, you will be asked to chose to store only the validated IP addresses under MalakhProxy.csv or not

Enjoy!

Note: This program was designed to help users in IRAN to search and validate good & working proxies to bypass internet restrictions and IP Blockage.
